        <h4> The Last Straw _Bosworth Crocker_</h4>
         SCENE: _The basement of a large apartment-house in New York City.

        SCENE: _The kitchen of the Bauer flat in the basement of the Bryn
        Mawr. A window at the side gives on an area and shows the walk
        above and the houses across the street. Opposite the windows is a
        door to an inner room. Through the outer door, in the centre of the
        back wall, a dumb-waiter and whistles to tenants can be seen. A
        broken milk-bottle lies in a puddle of milk on the cement floor in
        front of the dumb-waiter. To the right of the outer door, a
        telephone; gas-range on which there are flat-irons heating and
        vegetables cooking. To the left of the outer door is an old
        sideboard; over it hangs a picture of Schiller. Near the centre of
        the room, a little to the right, stands a kitchen table with four
        chairs around it. Ironing-board is placed between the kitchen table
        and the sink, a basket of dampened clothes under it. A large
        calendar on the wall. An alarm-clock on the window-sill. Time: a
        little before noon. The telephone rings_; MRS. BAUER _leaves her
        ironing and goes to answer it_.
